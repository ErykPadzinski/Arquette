# Arquette 
Arquette is a pretty simple E-commerce shop with clothes.
I made it for fun and to improve my skills 
to launch it you need tu use commands:

1. npm install
2. npm run dev -- --host

For now im working on mobile version. In future steps i want to:
    
    -Start working on destkop version.
    -Create my own API with products.
    -Create product details page.
    -Create Basket.
    -Create checkout.
